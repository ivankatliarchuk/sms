## Hire an employee

The process of hiring an employee begins when the candidate successfully passes the job interview. The Human Resources department (HR) prepares a contract of employment together with an offer pack which contains the terms of employment with the company. The candidate has to return signed copy of contract and signed company's policies, proof of age and identity, pre-employment medical questionnaire, copies of highest professional/education certificates and, if applicable, a proof that he/she holds a work permit. All information about the new employee is recorded and the documentation returned by the employee kept in files. The HR issues a request to the IT Department about creation of a user account within the company's computer system and an email account for the new employee. The HR also issues a request to the QHSE Department for the new employee's orientation and health and safety training. The HR also send an information about the new employee to the Payroll Department.

## Finish probation

The probation period begins with successfully completed hiring process. At its end there is an end of probation assessment carried out by HR Department along with employee's line manager. If the assessment is not satisfactory the probation is extended for another period or the employment is terminated. If the probation is extended, an employee is informed what is the reason of that and what actions are required for successful finish of that extended probation. Otherwise the employment termination process is executed with immediate effect. At the end of the second probation a new assessment is carried out. This time, if assessment is satisfactory the employment become permanent, otherwise the employment termination process is executed with one week notice.

## Handle employee absence

An absence could be planned, such as holidays, or unexpected. In the case of the former, the employee's line manager has to set in advance a plan to cover employee's duties, so to minimise the impact of the absence on the business. If the absence is unexpected and the employee has not contacted the line manager during the first half of the working day, the line manager has to attempt to contact that employee to determine the cause of absence. If successful or employee contacted the manager and the absence is excused, the manager notes the reason and estimated time of the employee's return to duty and passes this to the HR Department, otherwise informs the HR Department about unannounced or not excused absence.

The HR Department review the employee's records regarding unannounced absences and records the current one. During next three days, if employee is still absent and is not contacting the company, the line manager makes multiple attempts to contact him/her via telephone or email. At the same time the HR Department tries to contact the employee's next of kin, if there are contact details of such person in the employee's record. If no contact attempt is successful, the HR Department checks with other employees to see if the absent one gave notice to some other supervisor and records all attempts to contact the employee taken so far. The next step is to send to the employee a registered letter with information about the number of days he/she has been absent without any notice given to the employer and the date of the employment termination if the employee does not contact the company. If such letter will not cause a response, the HR Department documents termination of the employment due to voluntary quitting by the employee.

If during this time the employee or next of kin contacts the company and provides an excusable reason of absence, the fact is recorded and the whole process stopped. If the reason of absence is not excusable, the HR Department issues written warning to the employee with proof of receipt. Upon the employee's return to duty a meeting is held with him/her to discus the absence, allowing the employee to explain the circumstances, explaining to him/her how the absence affected the company and giving him/her a written notice of consequences of any further such absence and a very clear information that persistent absences will cause the termination of employment.

## Plan employee holidays

An employee has to submit a holiday request to his/her line manager at least a month in advance. If request is submitted later than that, the line manager can reject it on the basis of not having enough time to project how the employee's absence might impact the business and to prepare cover for that period. Even if the request is submitted timely, it could still be rejected if in the period requested or overlapping period there are already agreed holidays for some other employee and there is no way of covering duties of that many members of staff absent at the same time.

Once the request is approved, the line manager has to plan how to cover the employee's job for the period of his/her holidays. The line manager provides the employee going on holiday with a check list of what needs to be set up so the cover employee could take over his/her responsibilities for that time. On the last day before holidays the employee taking time off should provide a summary of work in progress, major responsibilities, information about key contacts and way of accessing all that is required to meet deadlines for that period.

## Manage employee development

Once a year, the line manager conducts an employee's performance assessment. During annual appraisal they discus employee's professional plans, checking how those plans fit into long-term and short-term goals and objectives of the company. Business needs are also the basis for the training plan that the employee is required to perform during the year and the line manager sets the date of their achievement during that meeting. If employee's plans align with business needs, the line manager has to asses if the employee is ready for their realisation, for example, are there any professional or private obstacles that could jeopardise the plan, discussing either modifications to the plan or moving the plan for the future. If employee is ready, then the line manager proposes a development plan. The results of the annual appraisal are presented in writing and signed by both parties.

At least once a quarter the line manager holds a meeting with the employee to check the progress in training and development and discuss any obstacles and change of circumstances relevant to the business. All information gathered is recorded for analysis and audit purposes. If necessary, the line manager modifies the training and development plan for the employee. Skills and qualifications already achieved by the employee can be taken into consideration for his/her promotion, application for which the line manager submits to the managing director.

## Track employee training

Every employee is responsible for keeping a record of his/her trainings. Each record contains information about the training, an evidence of performance, and a certificate of completion, if applicable. Each training record has to be approved be the line manager or a person designated by the line manager. If a training requires achieving several consecutive levels of competence, each level needs its own evidence and has to be approved by either the line manager or a person designated by the line manager. The line manager has the authority to approve a level of competence without prior training based on judgement of employee's previous experience, but this has to be recorded using a 'fast track' form. The line manager has to periodically check training records of members of staff so all records are up to date and no one is performing his/her duties without required level of training.

## Reward employee

An employee in recognition of his/her exceptional work or professional achievements can be awarded within the department or the whole company. There are several options available. One of them is to award him/her with the title 'Employee of the Month' if selected from among the candidates submitted by line managers. Once a year, one of the employees of the month is awarded with the title 'Employee of the Year', and in addition receives a financial bonus. The line manager can award exceptional member of staff with a gift card or, if not disruptive to the business, a half-day off on Friday. Another way of recognition is to give such employee a written thank you note during the meeting of the department.
All rewards are recorded in employee's files so they could be taken into consideration during annual salary review.

## Discipline employee

Any employee's action at work that is a breach of the company's policies is subject to disciplinary action. The reason for such action could be behaviour at work, absence from work or standard of work. If the reason is not serious, the line manager should first try to solve the problem informally, having a conversation with an employee. Only if the situation repeats, the line manager starts formal disciplinary procedures. The disciplinary action is carried out automatically if the breach of the company's policies is serious. If as a result, a decision is made about termination of the employment, the relevant procedure is carried out. Otherwise the outcome of the action is recorded in the employee's files. If the situation repeats, the employment can be terminated.

## Terminate employment

An employment contract can be terminated at any time by either an employee or the employer and it could be a resignation, dismissal, redundancy or retirement. While fulfilling the preparatory steps required by the law, the HR Department issues a request to the IT Department about revocation of access to all computer, network and data that the employee has, that should be proceeded at the time of employee's leave or immediately in the case of dismissal. Another request to the IT is about preservation of data related to that employee that could be of legal significance. The HR sends also an information about termination to the Payroll Department. The employee is obliged to return all equipment provided to him/her by the company to perform his/her duties. The HR conducts an exit interview with the employee. If the employee plans to seek employment, the HR asks him/her to sign a form giving the company permission to provide reference information at the request of potential employers. After termination is done, former employee's records are updated and archived.
