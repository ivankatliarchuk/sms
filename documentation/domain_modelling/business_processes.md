## Hire an employee

The process of hiring an employee begins when the candidate successfully passes the job interview. The Human Resources department (HR) prepares a contract of employment together with an offer pack which contains the terms of employment with the company. The candidate has to return signed copy of contract and signed company's policies, proof of age and identity, pre-employment medical questionnaire, copies of highest professional/education certificates and, if applicable, a proof that he/she holds a work permit. All information about the new employee is recorded and the documentation returned by the employee kept in files. The HR issues a request to the IT Department about creation of a user account within the company's computer system and an email account for the new employee. The HR also issues a request to the QHSE Department for the new employee's orientation and health and saferty training. The HR also send an information about the new employee to the Payroll Department.
