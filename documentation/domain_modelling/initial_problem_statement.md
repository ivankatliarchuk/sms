# Initial problem statement: staff management

Every company has to manage its staff and all associated data, including personal data, payroll, absences, training, etc. The Staff Management System (SMS) is intended as a tool that integrate all activities related to staff management under one system coordinating work of various departments involved in that process and giving management wider control over company's human resources.

## System domain

In a model company, based on which this system is designed, there are nember of departments, each of which may have zero, one or more sections. If a section has just one member of staff, that person reports directly to the head of the department that the section is part of. Each section that has more than one staff member has a section coordinator who reports to the department head. If members of staff within a section are organised into teams, each team has a team leader that reports to the section coordinator. Department head reports to the managing director.

Each department and section has a unique name. Teams within a section are distinquished by consecutive letters of the alphabet. Some departments or sections may be located elsewhere than the rest of the company.

Each regular employee has contractual obligation to work a particular number of hours per week within time frame set by the company and is paid with basic salary and, if applied, shift allowance. In the case of overtime the employee is paid hourly rate that is agreed within the employment contract. In the case of an employee that holds a managerial contract different rules may apply. Each employee has right to annual paid holiday.

A new employee must satisfactorily complete a probationary period that can be extended if required but only once and for a period not longer than the first one. At the end there is an end of probation assessment carried out that may lead to not renewing the employment contract if the assessment is not satisfactory. There is not minimum term of employment during the first probationary period, but during the extended probation the notice needed to end employment is one week for either party. After successful completion of the probation the length of notice required from either employee or employer extends to a period guaranteed by the law. An employee has to provide a prove that he/she holds a work permit, if applicable.

If absent, an employee must inform his/her line manager about the reason of the absence and expected date of return to work as soon as possible. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action and the company may withold sick pay. On return the employee is required to provide certification either from doctor or oneself, depending the rules applicable to that case.

Each employee after satisfactory completion of the probationary period is entitled to join the company pension scheme if one is provided.

The company provides all means required for an employee to carry out his/her duties. If electronic devices are provided like laptop or mobile phone, they remain company's properties and the employee is restricted to use them for business purposes with accordance to the applicable company policies. The company keeps records of the devices held by each employee.

Once a year, the employee's performance is assessed during annual appraisal by his/her line manager and the objectives for the next year are set at the same time. The progress in their achievement is assessed at least once a quarter, so the manager has control over the professional development of his/her subordinates. The professional training of each employee is measured and recorded for analysis and audit purposes. The line manager can, if necessary, order additional training for his/her personel.
