# SMS

SMS stands for Staff Management System.

## Project description

The purpose of this project is creation of a tool that could help a company manage its staff and all associated data, including personal data, payroll, absences, training, etc. It is also a practical exercise of what I learned during the academic year 2018/2019 while studying _TM354 Software engineering_ at the Open University.

I will mainly follow the [Unified Software Development Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process), using good practices described in my study materials and books that I always have in the reach of my hand (see [Bibliography](#bibliography)).

All diagrams in the project documentation are created using [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/), free, open-source UML tool with a simple user interface, which also has web-based version, called [UMLetino](http://www.umletino.com/).

This is an open source project released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (details, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).
