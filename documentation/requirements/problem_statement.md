# Staff Management System

## Problem Statement

Every company has to manage its staff and all associated data, including personal data, payroll, absences, training, etc. The Staff Management System (SMS) is intended as a tool that integrate all activities related to staff management under one system coordinating work of various departments involved in that process and giving management wider control over company's human resources.

## System domain

In a model company for which this system is designed, there are nember of departments, each of which may have zero, one or more sections. If a section has just one member of staff, that person reports directly to the head of the department that the section is part of. Each section that has more than one staff member has a section coordinator who reports to the department head. If members of staff within a section are organised into teams, each team has a team leader that reports to the section coordinator. Department head reports to the managing director.

Each department and section has a unique name. Teams within a section are distinquished by consecutive letters of the alphabet. Some departments or sections may be located elsewhere than the rest of the company.

Each regular employee has contractual obligation to work a particular number of hours per week within time frame set by the company and is paid with basic salary and shift allowance, if applied. In the case of overtime the employee is paid hourly rate that is agreed within the employment contract. In the case of an employee that holds a managerial contract different rules may apply.
